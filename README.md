# Current Features/Capabilities
- 🔧 **Hybrid Mounting System**  
  Combines a large Velcro surface with two neodymium magnets for constant pressure against the steel plate.
  
- 🛡️ **Durable Materials**  
  - **ASA plastic**: UV and impact resistant, ideal for outdoor use.  
  - **TPU rubber**: Provides shock absorption and prevents shattering under repeated impacts.  

- 🎯 **Adaptable Design**  
  Compatible with multiple hit indicators:
  - Coriolis Hit Indicator (future project to be completed)
  - Caldwell Flash Bang  
  - MagnetoSpeed T1000  
  - Can be adapted to virtually any hit indicator with future iteration
